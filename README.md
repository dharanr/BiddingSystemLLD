<pre> Design a Bidding System, wherein
   •  Vendors, who can come and put their products up for bidding 
      for a given slot within a date and time duration. 
      
   •  The registered users can visit the page 
      to check the different products (by category), 
      which are up for bidding. They can choose and bid for a product of their choice. 
      
   •  Each product has a base price, and the bidding for that product 
      can be done with a price which is higher or equal to this base price. 
      A bidding for a lesser price should throw an error. 
      
   •  At the end of the slot duration for a given product, 
      choose the winner and send a communication to them. 
   
   
Design the backend system for this problem.
AIM for:
   •  Design micro-services with
   •  Well defined API contracts
   •  Right protocol - REST/GraphQL
   •  Well defined status code and messages, error handling.
   •  Choose appropriate backend tech,
      databases and design a clean data model, with solid reasoning.
   •  Try following TDD or have good coverage for Unit Tests.
   •  Apply design patterns wherever applicable.
   
 Bonus:
   •  List out the Non-Functional areas that you would strategize 
      to deploy this application to production and how do you suggest to achieve the same.</pre>
