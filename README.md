<pre> Design a Bidding System, wherein <br>
   •  Vendors, who can come and put their products up for bidding for a given slot within a date and time duration. 
   •  The registered users can visit the page to check the different products (by category), 
      which are up for bidding. They can choose and bid for a product of their choice. 
   •  Each product has a base price, and the bidding for that product can be done with a price which is higher or equal to this base price. 
      A bidding for a lesser price should throw an error. 
   •  At the end of the slot duration for a given product, choose the winner and send a communication to them.
